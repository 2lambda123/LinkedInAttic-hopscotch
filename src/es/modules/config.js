/**
 * As the name suggests, config objects store configuration information for
 * tours, steps, standalone callouts, and global options. It's probably easier
 * to think of configs as the primary data layer for components throughout
 * the Hopscotch ecosystem.
 *
 * We've set up configuration objects to naturally encompass a hierarchical
 * structure, to reflect that many options can be set globally or
 * on a tour-by-tour basis. Commonly, you'll see the hierarchy for config
 * objects as follows...
 *
 * ````
 * default
 *     |
 *     |
 *     |
 * global (hopscotch.configure)
 *     |
 *     |

 *     |                                      |
 * tour (from tour JSON)               standalone callout (from callout JSON)
